# Doggo Viewer

Doggo Viewer is a simple web app that allows users to fetch random pictures of dogs based on breed selection using an API. It showcases the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a functional, responsive app with a clean UI. This project demonstrates my ability to work with APIs, style elements, and create a smooth user experience.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I built this project as a learning exercise to improve my skills in JavaScript and API integration. The project uses the Dog API to fetch random dog images based on the breed selected from a dropdown menu. JavaScript handles the API call and dynamically updates the DOM with the new image and information about the dog. I focused on making the app responsive using CSS and ensuring a clean and user-friendly interface with elements like dropdown menus and hover effects.

- **HTML**: Structured the page with clear sections for dog images, breed selection, and dog characteristics.
- **CSS**: Styled the UI with a modern, professional look, adding gradients, shadows, and responsive layouts.
- **JavaScript**: Handled API fetching, user input via the breed dropdown, and DOM manipulation to display dog data.

## Optimizations

I initially had some redundancy in my JavaScript code, particularly when handling API requests. I later refactored the code to be more modular and efficient, significantly improving maintainability and readability. I also optimized the image loading by adding a loading spinner, so users arenâ€™t left waiting without feedback. This approach made the app feel smoother and more responsive to user interactions.

## Lessons Learned:

This project deepened my understanding of working with APIs and handling asynchronous JavaScript. I learned how to efficiently fetch data, manipulate the DOM, and optimize the user experience for responsiveness. Styling the app was a fun challenge as I aimed to strike a balance between simplicity and professionalism. One key takeaway was learning to refactor code to improve both performance and readability, which is essential in larger projects.
